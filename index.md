## About Me

I am a Statistics Ph.D Student at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca" target="_blank"> McGill University</a>, supervised by Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=JEqpO-MAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Abbas Khalili</a> and co-supervised by Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=NRlAymQAAAAJ" target="_blank"> David Stephens</a>. My main research area is developing statistical models under distributed setting that deal with high-dimensional data. There are two challenges confronted: First, how to deal with heterogeneous data distributed at different sites. Second, how to make sure the data privacy when summary statistics information is shared among these local sites. Also, I am still exploring any other interesting research areas. 

Prior to starting my phd journey, I obatained my master degree in Statistics from <a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/en" target = "_blank"> University of Ottawa</a> advised by Prof. <a href= "https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/malvo" target = "_blank"> Mayer Alvo. 


## Research Interests
