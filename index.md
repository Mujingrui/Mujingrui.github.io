## About Me

I am a Statistics Ph.D Student at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca" target="_blank"> McGill University</a>, supervised by Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=JEqpO-MAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Abbas Khalili</a> and co-supervised by Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=NRlAymQAAAAJ" target="_blank"> David Stephens</a>. My main research area is developing statistical models under distributed setting that deal with high-dimensional data. There are two challenges confronted: First, how to deal with heterogeneous data distributed at different sites. Second, how to make sure the data privacy when summary statistics information is shared among these local sites. 

Prior to starting my phd journey, I obatained my master degree in Statistics from <a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/en" target = "_blank"> University of Ottawa</a> advised by Prof. <a href= "https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/malvo" target = "_blank"> Mayer Alvo.
